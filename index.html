                <ul>CodeScape: The Algorithm Escape Room is an immersive and interactive experience where computer science meets adventure.
                    Designed for puzzle lovers and tech enthusiasts, this event challenges teams to solve algorithm-based mysteries inspired by real CS concepts — including recursion, encryption, sorting, and more.
                    <br><br>
                Participants will work together to unlock clues, crack digital codes, and "escape" by solving a series of logic-driven 
                    challenges. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, CodeScape offers a fun, hands-on way to sharpen your problem-solving skills.
